## Deployment

-   `npm run start`: starts a server on [port 3000](localhost:3000) and watches files for changes, compiling them on the fly
-   `npm run build`: compiles all files to the `build/` directory but doesn't watch for changes or start a server
-   `npm run deploy-event`: pushes to the `gh-pages` branch of this repository and deploys the site to hacktj.org/202x
-   `npm run deploy-homepage`: pushes to the [hacktj.github.io repo](https://github.com/HackTJ/hacktj.github.io) and deploys the site to <https://hacktj.org>
-   `npm run deploy-all`: shortcut for both `npm run deploy-event` and `npm run deploy-homepage`

In the case that one of the endpoints (/2020 or /) doesn't work but the other does, immediately set up a hardcoded redirect in the nonfunctional repository to redirect to the correct site. 

## Notes for next year

-   click "Use this template" (next to the clone or download dropdown) and name the new repository `2021`, under the HackTJ organizationâ€”that way it will be displayed on our website at <https://hacktj.org/2021> while leaving the old website up at <https://hacktj.org/2020>
-   all of the deploy commands involve running the `switch` script in this repository
    -   if you notice that this script deletes the content of either [`public/index.html`](public/index.html) or [`src/App.js`](src/App.js), immediately quit the deploy script and restore the contents with `git` and retry the `npm` script until it works
-   the `deploy-event` script doesn't commit the source code to the repository's master branch, it only commits the built code
    -   you should commit the source code to the `master` branch each time you deploy
        -   before you commit to `master`, always make sure you run `npm run switch-event`
            -   if you need to, create a [pre-commit hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_pre_commit) to automatically do this
-   don't run `git pull` after `npm run switch-homepage`
    -   only pull when you're set up for the event repository
