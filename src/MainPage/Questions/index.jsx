                                    &quot;hacking&quot; is to build a real
                                    application over the length of the event.
                                    It&apos;s important to not confuse this with
                                    illegal hacking, which is gaining

                                    Mentors work interactively with students to
                                    help them develop their projects. This could
                                    mean brainstorming ideas, teaching students
                                    new skills or languages, and troubleshooting
                                    when they run into obstacles. If you have

                                    any time during HackTJ, you can be a mentor!
                                    Judges listen to student pitches during our
                                    Sunday-morning expo and decide which
                                    projects are winners. Experience is
                                    preferred but not necessary. Volunteers help
                                    our team with logistical tasks such as
                                    check-in, food service, and chaperoning. No
                                    experience is necessary to be a volunteer.
